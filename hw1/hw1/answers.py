Yes. A higher K would lead to improved generalization for unseen data.   
Up to the point of including all the training samples. While this would be a very generalized predictor, 
it would also have a very high bias as instead of fitting the test sample to it's neighbors it matches it to the whole 
dataset.

1. In terms of the train-set accuracy --- by doing cross validation we actually introduce or model to more variances of data, 
allowing it to generalize better as we chose the best mean accuracy between the folds. 

2. In terms of the test-set accuracy --- using cross-validation allows you to find the best hyper-params (k in our case) 
without overfitting the testset. This way we are able to see which k optimizes our validation set, 
and apply it on the test set. Thus we grantee that the test-set was not contaimed and our results are accurate.
