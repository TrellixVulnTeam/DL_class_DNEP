During training we want the model to expriement by choosing different chars and only the most proabable ones. however, when generating text we want lower 'mistakes' and to stick to probabilities learned by the model. And so and by lowering the tempature we are giving a higher probability to models chosen chars.  \n",

When the tempature approaches 0 it is most likely to get stuck in an infinite loop, this happens because your model becomes very confident and doesn't diversify the text. \n"
